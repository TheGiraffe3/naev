# Great House Dvaered

House Dvaered is one of the Great Houses of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire).
It evolved from the simple working class of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) during the [Second Growth and the Faction Wars](lore/history) and was granted the status of a Great House by the Emperor during the golden age of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire).
Today, it is governed by the military and the armed forces dominate much of the everyday lives of the Dvaered citizens.
Planets are governed by Warlords, former members of the Dvaered High Command, which makes all the most important decisions about the House.
The Warlords regulate life on a local basis, while the High Command directs the Faction as a whole.
The only way of rising up is usually to join the military and earn medals and commendations.

## History

House Dvaered came forth from a lower caste in the old Empire, a collection of miners, manual laborers, foot soldiers, and outcasts.
With the gradual decline in authority of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire), the working class became increasingly disgruntled with their social position.
They banded together into what could be considered the biggest labor union in all of human history, and started demanding better treatment.

When [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) was less than forthcoming, the laborers began to take more drastic measures.
The labor union turned into a resistance movement that escalated into open rebellion on several worlds.
History names this movement the Dvaered Revolts.
The origin of that name is unclear, but it became common among the rebelling workers.

Cycles of civil unrest on the working planets and fruitless attempts on the part of [the Empire](lore/factions/empire) to quell it eventually led the Emperor of that time to agree to the Dvaereds' demands.
Their leaders were granted the right to establish a Great House, and direct control over a sizeable chunk of space, in reparation for the lives lost during the Dvaered Revolts.

Eager to claim their place among the other big players, the then-time Dvaered leadership decided that discipline was the only proper way to shape a society.
And so House Dvaered evolved into a military regime, and the values of honor and strength were etched into the Dvaered soul.

## Government

Today, House Dvaered is ruled by the Generals of the Dvaered military.
The amount of Generals varies from time to time, but there are always enough to feed the fires of internal discord.
Influence is usually determined by the amount of medals and commendations a General has collected in his career.
This at least stands undisputed, for House Dvaered has extensive protocols for dispensing awards.
In fact, it can be considered a constitution of sorts.

### Warlords

When a General retires from High Command, he often takes with him a small contingent of the armed forces.
These are soldiers and captains who have sworn allegiance to the man, not the banner, and they will continue to serve until the bitter end.
The General, now known as a Warlord, will then use his little private army to secure rule over one or more Dvaered worlds, usually by usurping the position from another Warlord.
This method of local government is commonly accepted to be legal, and no Dvaered citizen will be surprised when suddenly a new set of local laws will be passed to replace another.

### Citizens

The Dvaered citizenry itself is barely worthy of the name.
There is often more squalor than culture, and more often than not the Dvaered will seek employment in the military, despite the dangers that represents.
Nevertheless, there certainly is a Dvaered elite.
They often concentrate on the few truly hospitable worlds in Dvaered space, where they pursue their idea of luxury.

### Warlords and Dvaered High Command

While every Dvaered controlled world is governed by a Warlord at any given time, it is Dvaered High Command that the Warlords ultimately answer to.
Though Dvaered High Command is more military than government, it needs a steady stream of funds, manpower and materials to further its agenda.
Each Warlord is required to pay a certain portion of his worlds' resources in tax.
Failure to do so results in a swift and permanent removal by Dvaered High Command, after which the worlds previously held by that warlord become available to any other Warlords with the will to take them (which is to say, all of them).
