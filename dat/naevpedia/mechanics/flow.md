# Psychic Powers and Flow

[House Sirius](lore/factions/sirius) is renowned for psychic prowess, however, most psychic powers are very weak and require large amplifiers to maximize the potential.
Psychic users can use either a ship fabricated by [House Sirius](lore/factions/sirius) or special outfits such as flow amplifiers to enable the use of psychic abilities in space.
Such psychic abilities can be further enhanced by using meditation chambers and flow resonators to increase the psychic potential.

When a ship has a psychic amplifier, either built-in or through an outfit, flow will be enabled and visible through the GUI.
By default, flow will regenerate naturally up to 50% of the natural amount.
Furthermore, taking damage in the ship will generate flow, although this will decay if over 50% of the maximum amount.

Flow can be used to activate psychic abilities, which must be acquired, generally through Obelisk trials.
Abilities can be equipped like normal outfits and bound to [weapon sets](mechanics/weaponsets) to be used.
For each obtained ability, maximum flow will be increased by 5%.
