# Effects

Ships can be affected by different effects that can be either beneficial or detrimental.
Although effects are usually applied through outfits, such as being hit by weapon fire or triggering some outfit, they can also be applied from other sources.
Effects applied to your ship are visible at the top of the GUI with effects in #Fgreen#0 indicating beneficial effects, while those in #Hred#0 indicate detrimental effects.
Some types of effects can stack multiple types, which will be indicated by a number on the icon indicating how many stacks there are, while others will get refreshed when reapplied.
