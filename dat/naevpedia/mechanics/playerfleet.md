# Fleets

Besides your own ship, it is possible to deploy and command a fleet of ships when out in space.
You can deploy any ship you own as a fleet member, as long as it is space worthy by right-clicking on them or toggling the deployed checkbox.
The amount of ships you can deploy deeps on your **fleet capacity**.
Each ship, including your own, requires a certain amount of **fleet capacity**.
The total sum of fleet capacity from your deployed ships may not surpass your **fleet capacity**.
When deployed ships are destroyed, they will regenerate the next time you land.
